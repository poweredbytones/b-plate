## Installation
1. Fork the repository, and clone to your workspace, install in your chosen IDE.

2. Create a MySQL database on your local installation.

3. Create 'application.properties' in the top-level directory of the project and enter your database credentials.  This is the code you are looking for:


```
# Database connection settings
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:8889/b-plate
spring.datasource.username = username
spring.datasource.password = password

## Keep the connection alive if idle for a long time (needed in production)
#spring.datasource.testWhileIdle = true
#spring.datasource.validationQuery = SELECT 1

# Specify the DBMS
spring.jpa.database = MYSQL

# Show or not log for each sql query
spring.jpa.show-sql = false

# Hibernate ddl auto (create, create-drop, update)
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update

# Use spring.jpa.properties.* for Hibernate native properties (the prefix is
# stripped before adding them to the entity manager)
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect = org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5Dialect

# Turn off security protocol requiring login to run app
security.basic.enabled=false

# Sendgrid makes this easier to setup, true story
spring.mail.host = smtp.sendgrid.net
spring.mail.port = 25 
spring.mail.username = yourusername
spring.mail.password = yourpassword
spring.mail.protocol = smtp
#spring.mail.defaultEncoding = UTF-8
```
